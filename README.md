# Final
Welcome To dodgy Doggy!
I worked by myself in this game.
The purpose of the game is to help the dog avoid the water droplets, Using the keys "A" for left and "D" for right help control the dog. As the rain dropplets fall they increase in speed. For every raindrop you avoid you score goes up by 1.
